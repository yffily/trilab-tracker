- Add a "prepare" tab with buttons to compute the background and detect the tank. The latter goes hand-in-hand with porting the current interactive tank detection gui from cv2 to pyqt5+pyqtgraph.

- Figure out how to handle mouse drag in pyqt5+pyqtgraph.

- Fix aspect ratio of cv2 windows in Windows10. This may become obsolete after port to pyqt5+pyqtgraph.

- Pick a third order moment to save at every time step (along with position, angle, area, and aspect ratio) to help identify the front of each fish in post-processing.
