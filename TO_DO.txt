- Implement a track-fixing history. Make it saveable and loadable. Later, make it reversible (revert last change with ctrl+z), then fully editable (scroll through history and delete/edit any fixing operation then recompute the fixed track).

- (Fix aspect ratio of cv2 windows in Windows10.) Rewrite the tank detection as part of the viewer.
