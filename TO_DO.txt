- Guess each fish's forward direction using the contour data (maybe the contour's third moments?). Right now I think we only use the velocity vector and frame continuity.

- When aligning a fish's orientation with its velocity, consider using a velocity averaged over the past few frames to avoid short-lived position errors unduly reversing the direction.

- Right now pretty much everything is in verbose mode. Create a silent mode, or possibly versbosity levels.

- Fix aspect ratio of cv2 windows in Windows10.

- [?] Try out regular (non-adaptive) thresholding in combination with simple background subtraction.
