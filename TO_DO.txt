- [?] Tracker: Change handling of extra objects. First choose the contours most likely to be fish. Only then, connect them to objects in the previous frame.

- Viewer: Put colored rectangles in the frame slider's background to indicate tracking issues. 

- Viewer: Add option to export a video based on current view/settings. Make it possible to pick a frame range.

- Add a "prepare" tab with buttons to compute the background and detect the tank. The latter goes hand-in-hand with porting the current interactive tank detection gui from cv2 to pyqt5+pyqtgraph.
  [May require deep changes, including moving background creation to somewhere it can be shared by the tracker and the viewer.] 

- Figure out how to handle mouse drag in pyqt5+pyqtgraph.

- Pick a third order moment to save at every time step (along with position, angle, area, and aspect ratio) to help identify the front of each fish in post-processing.
