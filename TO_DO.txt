- Guess each fish's forward direction using the contour data (maybe the contour's third moments?). Right now I think we only use the velocity vector and frame continuity.

- Add an optional frame range to use for background computation. It would avoid having to recut raw videos in which the camera moved near the beginning or the end.

- Right now pretty much everything is in verbose mode. Create a silent mode, or possibly versbosity levels.

- Work on CVTracer::connect_frames. There seems to be an occasional issue in which two fish swap ID's after one was lost for a few frames even though their positions haven't changed enough for there to be any ambiguity as to which is which.

- Make simple background subtraction part of TrAQ. 

- [?] Try out regular (non-adaptive) thresholding in combination with simple background subtraction.

- Fix aspect ratio of cv2 windows in Windows10.
